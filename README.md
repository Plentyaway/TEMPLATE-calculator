# Calculator Project

## Introduction
In this project you will be making a very simple calculator web page. This is a primer to review what you've learned about web development, and GitHub.

## Outcome
The finished product will be a "version 1.0" calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and clear the screen. It will look nice and have *most* of the features necessary to function. It meets the requirements for a **Potentially Shippable Product**. It will also have features that are **not yet implemented**, which you will be free to add *on your own* (ie. version 1.1).

## Timeline
This project will take about 2 weeks.

## Branches
- **Master**: This is the branch that your customers will run. They expect it to be complete, mostly bug free, and to update *occasionally*. Don't constantly push changes here! (Imagine getting notified to update your iPad apps every. single. day!)
- **Version 1.0**: This is the branch that you're working towards. Make changes directly to *other* branches and pull request (PR) them to this one.
- **Other branches**: You may have as many other branches as you wish. If you are working on two separate projects (ie. **branch1** and **branch2**) and merge one (**branch1**) into **Version1.0**, you'll need to merge **Version1.0** back onto the other branch (**branch2**) to get those changes. Practice doing this at least once, as you will need to do it in your group project.
