# Calculator Project

## Introduction
In this project you will be making a very simple calculator web page. This is a primer to review what you've learned about web development, and GitHub.

## Outcome
The finished product will be a **Version 1.0**-calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and clear the screen. It will look nice and have *most* of the features necessary to function. It meets the requirements for a **Potentially Shippable Product**. It will also have features that are **not yet implemented**, which *you will need to add on your own* (ie. version 1.1).

## Timeline
This project will take about 2 weeks. Mr. Scheuerlein will walk you through creating **Version 1.0** in the first week and then you will have the second week to finish whichever missing features you want.

## Missing Features
You are free to add whichever features you want, but below are some suggestions if you're not sure what to do:

- [ ] The memory functions have not yet been implemented. Implement them.
- [ ] The try/catch will display an error message for invalid input, but could you prevent invalid input in the first place?
  - [ ] Repeated decimals (ie. "1.2.3 + 4" = "Error")
  - [ ] Pressing the equals key when the screen is blank ("undefined")
  - [ ] Pressing the equals key when the screen is "undefined" ("NaN")
  - [ ] What other errors are there? Can you prevent them?
- [ ] Most calculators display a "0" when you clear them. Make this calculator display "0" upon clearing.
- [ ] It's a little odd that it can display "123+456". Fix it. (Do you still need an "=" button?)
- [ ] Add some keys. Hint: JavaScript has built-in functions and constants for most of these. Look them up to learn how to use them.
  - [ ] Constants: e, Ï€, etc.
  - [ ] Square root
  - [ ] Exponents
- [ ] Clicking takes too much work. Make it so pressing your keyboard keys behaves like clicking on the calculator's keys. Note: this is probably the hardest feature to implement! Expect to do some research!

## Grading
This project is worth 20 points.
- Functionality (10 points): Does it work? Did you add features?
- Documentation (10 points): Is the code organized and easy to understand? Do you explain what things are *supposed* to do?

## Branches
- **Master**: This is the branch that your customers will run. They expect it to be complete, mostly bug free, and to update *occasionally*. Don't constantly push changes here! (Imagine getting notified to update your iPad apps every. single. day!)
- **Version 1.0**: This is the branch that you're working towards. Make changes directly to *other* branches and pull request (PR) them to this one.
- **Other branches**: You may have as many other branches as you wish. If you are working on two separate projects (ie. **branch1** and **branch2**) and merge one (**branch1**) into **Version1.0**, you'll need to merge **Version1.0** back onto the other branch (**branch2**) to get those changes. Practice doing this at least once, as you will need to do it in your group project.
